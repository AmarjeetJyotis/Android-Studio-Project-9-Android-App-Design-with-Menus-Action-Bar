# Android Layout Inspector Demo App

This project is a demonstration Android application built to experiment with and inspect layout structures using **Android Studio's Layout Inspector** tool.

## 📱 Overview

The app displays a simple and clean UI showcasing:
- A **TextView** with the developer's name (`Amarjeet Kumar`)
- Basic layout and view hierarchy suited for learning how Android's Layout Inspector works in real-time

It runs on a virtual or physical Android device (tested on **Pixel 6 emulator – API 29**) and provides a live example for layout debugging, hierarchy traversal, and design preview in Android Studio.

## 🔧 Features

- UI rendered using standard Android layouts
- Compatible with Android Studio Layout Inspector
- Minimalistic view for focus on layout analysis
- Support for API Level 29+
